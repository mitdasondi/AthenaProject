# AthenaProject

This repository addresses the tasks provided through the following deliverables:

## Time-Series Model:

The Time-Series Model is implemented using Python along with the following libraries:
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization
- statsmodels or Prophet for time-series forecasting

### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert the date columns to datetime objects and optionally aggregate the data to the desired time frequency (e.g., monthly, weekly).
3. **Visualization**: Create time-series visualizations based on filters such as region, vehicle type, etc.
4. **Analysis**: Explore seasonal decomposition, trend analysis, and possibly forecasting if necessary.

## Data Enrichment Recommendations:

To enrich the dataset, additional data sources are recommended, including:
- **Weather Data**: Weather significantly influences vehicle demand, especially for certain types like convertibles or SUVs.
- **Economic Indicators**: Economic conditions affect purchasing power, thus influencing vehicle sales.
- **Competitor Data**: Understanding competitors' pricing and inventory levels provides valuable insights.

### Potential Analyses:
- Correlation between weather patterns and sales.
- Impact of economic indicators on demand.
- Competitive analysis based on pricing and inventory levels.

## Data Warehouse Structure:

The proposed data warehouse structure integrates the existing dataset with additional data sources seamlessly. It includes:
- Star or snowflake schema design
- Fact tables for sales/inventory data
- Dimension tables for regions, vehicle types, time, weather, economic indicators, and competitors

The warehouse is built on a scalable platform like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery for efficient querying and analysis. Access to the warehouse is democratized through role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure stakeholders can access relevant data.

### Appendix:
Diagrams illustrating the proposed schema and architecture will be provided.

Given this outline, the implementation will start with the Time-Series Model to understand temporal patterns, guiding further analyses and data enrichment decisions.
